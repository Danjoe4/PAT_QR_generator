V1 We actually do the thing, take the info and create a encrypted QR

V2 Change the encryption out for a minimalistic hashing algo to have a smaller more aesthetic QR code. On the second page, add width & height options and a print button.

V3 After you play with the dimensions on your printer, I will make the default dimensions the appropriate size. We can also hook up the domain at this time.

V0_4 (Post-Demo) Discard the entire frontend and turn this into a REST API, likely with some sort of authentication for clients (username/password or API key). Should conform to the needs of the Bose packaging designers/software/process.
